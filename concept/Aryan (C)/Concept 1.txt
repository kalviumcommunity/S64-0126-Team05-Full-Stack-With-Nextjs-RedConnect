Case Study Analysis: The News Portal That Felt Outdated
At DailyEdge, the homepage was originally built using static rendering. This made the site extremely fast and scalable, but it also caused a major issue — the “Breaking News” section often showed old headlines. Since static pages are generated at build time, the content didn’t update unless the site was rebuilt, which is not ideal for time-sensitive news.
To solve this, the team switched the entire homepage to server-side rendering. While this fixed the freshness problem and ensured users always saw the latest news, it introduced new challenges. Page load times became slower, server usage increased, and hosting costs went up, especially during high-traffic periods.
A better and more balanced solution is hybrid rendering using Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) in Next.js. With ISR, the homepage can stay fast like a static page but still update automatically at regular intervals using revalidate. For example, refreshing the homepage every 60 seconds keeps breaking news reasonably fresh without putting constant pressure on the server. Sections that truly need real-time data, like breaking news feeds or user dashboards, can use dynamic rendering, while individual news articles can remain fully static.
By choosing the right rendering strategy for each page, DailyEdge can maintain fast performance, fresh content, and good scalability — without unnecessary cost or complexity.
